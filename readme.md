# Homework #11 Web Design Challenge 

Welcome to my Web Designing Challenge repo.  Here you can find a folder called css that contains a style.css file that contains my css codes, an Images folder that contains the guideline images of what the final website should display.  The Resources folder has a cities.csv file that contains the table that I used to run the weather analysis, and the various images of graphs that were products of that analysis. The rest are html files that are used to make my website.
